# <Project-1>

## Description

- This code displays a Destination Finder.
- We wanted to deploy this site to be able to search for weather and points of interest using JavaScript and third party API's.
- We coded JavaScript using Jquery and css using Foundation. Our API's were https://openweathermap.org/api & https://www.geoapify.com/maps-api. 
- Given more time we would add more queries like eateries, events, and transportation.
